## SUMMARY:
 In part A, I used simple python data such as lists, variables, and print statements in order to determine simple values (classes per week, cost per class, etc.) and print the results. In part B, I used a basic module called random (which generates pseudo-random numbers) as well as random commands, lists, and variables in order to generate and print a random choice from the list each time the program is run.
